# ESE2013 Team 5

Project: **Mensa@Unibe**

We have added an APK file to install the app without compiling (due problems with Maps API Key), it can be found here: http://goo.gl/Txbt3f

#### ToDo for release v1.0

- Documentation for the domain model exists and is helpful, concise, correct.
- The documentation is up-to-date.
- You have a sufficiently wide set of test cases.
- The code should be easy to read, understand and maintain. This includes a consistent coding style and meaningful naming.
- The repository is clean, that is, there are no unnecessary files, such as logs, notes, etc.
- If needed, provide demo data and accounts to test the application (user/pwd: ese/ese).
- Fix known bugs.
- Tag the release in the repository with v1.0.
- The app should run on Android 4.0 or newer.
- The Jenkins build should work correctly and all test should pass. This is mandatory.
